# 2035 Robotics Website
The new website is still a work in progress, for now please continue to refer to the current site [2035.rocks](https://2035.rocks) although the new website will continue to use this domain so expect to see changes to the website in the near future.

If you would like to assist in the creation of the replacement website, please talk to Alexander at the next weekly meeting, or whenever next convenient, alternatively try to contact some other member of leadership and contact me through them.

## Old website
For now simply refer to the old site at [2035.rocks](https://2035.rocks) or the repository [CarmelRobotics/carmelrobotics.github.io](https://github.com/CarmelRobotics/carmelrobotics.github.io).

Once the new website is online the old website may be deprecated or archived.
